  "para1": "Forests are one of our last and best chances to save our planet before it’s too late.",
  "para2": "A forest conjures images of sun dappled leaves, chirping birds, and fresh air. We see much more: a powerful investment in our future, managed with the goal of maximizing impact, delivering a real solution to mitigate climate change, and protected for generations.",
  "para3":"Under the right conditions, a forest can become a force of nature—quite literally. And that means driving corporations, students, and individuals across our country to invest in a large-scale plan that will see 10 million acres of new forests built by 2040.",
  "para4": "As for our “who”—well, that’s where you come in. Whether you represent [a company](/) seeking to diversify your ESG investments, [a school](/) looking for a meaningful vehicle to raise money and educate tomorrow’s climate advocates, [an individual](/) laying down roots for future generations, or [a community member](/) searching for new ways to grow, you have a role to play in the future of Canada’s forests—a role that’s intrinsically linked to the future of our planet.",

  "part1_para3": "As cultural attitudes towards climate change shift and become more urgent, market values will shift with them, ensuring that environmental, societal and economic interests can coexist.",
  "part1_para4": "It’s critically important that we learn from, engage with, and consult with Indigenous communities from across Canada.",
  "part1_para5": "By making the green economy accessible to everyone – from individuals to schools to corporations – we can help align values and promote tangible investments into a greener, cleaner and more sustainable planet.",
