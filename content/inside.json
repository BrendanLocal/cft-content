  "q1": "What is a Smart Forest?",
  "a1": "A Smart Forest is more than a collection of trees. It has a significant impact on climate change.",
  "a1list1": "Supports wildlife, improves air quality, and regulates water flow",
  "a1list2": "Offers a tangible way to offset a large carbon footprint",

  "a3a": "We saw a gap to do something truly impactful and sustainable in an area that needs resources, patience and bold action to combat climate change.",
  "a3b": "Under the right conditions, a forest will become a force of nature—quite literally. As the threat of climate change closes in, forests are one of our last and best chances to save our planet before it’s too late.",
  "a3c": "Our Smart Forests will capture millions of tonnes of CO2, rehabilitate ecosystems and create jobs, country-wide. And we will never clear-cut.",

  "q4": "How do you build a Smart Forest?",

  "a4list5para": "Audit, and set a no clear-cut guarantee on every forest",

  "q5": "How is Canada’s Forest Trust different from other tree planting organizations?",
  "a5a": "CFT takes a holistic approach to forestry that doesn't stop at planting trees. We ensure the long term health of our forests with certifiable monitoring and expert management. And we will protect our forests forever. We will tell you exactly where in Canada your seedlings are planted, the health of the land, the impact your seedlings / forest is having on biodiversity, etc.",
  "a5b": "We provide all of this information through a private portal with state of the art monitoring and measuring technology.",
  
  "q6": "Is CFT a Charitable Organization?",
  "a6": "Our choice to be a for profit at this point in our journey allows us the flexibility to enter into partnerships and make investments which we may not be able to do as a registered charity. We have structured CFT so that the lands can never be exploited for commercial reasons.",

  "q7": "When does a Smart Forest start to offset carbon?",
  "a7": "Within the first year of planting, forests will have already begun sequestering carbon in their roots and stems. The younger the tree, the more carbon it sequesters.",

  "q8": "What is a carbon offset?",
  "a8": "You offset your Carbon Footprint by making the amount of carbon you release in a year equal to the amount of carbon stored in your CFT Smart Forest.",

  "q9": "What does it cost to buy a Smart Forest?",
  "a9": "",

  "q10": "Is there a minimum amount to ‘own’ a Smart Forest?",
  "a10": "Yes. 1 Forest Trust Unit is measured in 5 acres, or at least 5,000 seedlings trees. Our communal forest allows for much lower than 5 acres so you are part of a forest.",

  "q11": "Can I buy a Smart Forest as a gift?",
  "a11": "",

  "q12": "Where does my money go?",
  "a12a": "CFT uses funds to acquire land, prepare it for planting, purchase seedlings, hire planters, perform forest management, insure the land and pay land tax, provide reporting and annual audits.",
  "a12b": "When you invest in a Smart Forest, you stay informed on its progress - from site selection to planting to ongoing maintenance and carbon footprint impact.",

  "q13": "How do you choose where to build Smart Forests?",
  "a13": "CFT sources lands across the country that are suitable for reforestation and will have maximum impact on the environment.",

  "q14": "How many trees will Canada’s Forest Trust plant per acre?",
  "a14": "The ideal number for a successful forest is approximately 1,000 seedlings per acre. Depending on the species and land, we can plant up to 1200 seedlings per acre. CFT is proud to pledge a no clear cut guarantee on every acre of forest we build.",

  "q15": "How do you choose where to build Smart Forests?",
  "a15a": "Our forestry experts will advise on the right mix of species for the soil and climate of each forest location.",
  "a15b": "As a common practice, CFT Smart Forests will be built with softwood species (conifers). These species are fast-growing and have needles that are kept year-round. Some examples of softwood species include: douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and whitespruce. We will also implement management practices that will promote hardwood growth.",

  "q16": "Can I visit my Smart Forest?",
  "a16": "",

  "q17": "Will you cut down a Smart Forest?",

  "q19": "How many jobs will Canada’s Forest Trust create?",
  "a19": "Our business plan is to create thousands of jobs across Canada. Each phase of our 5 Phase Action Plan will require person-power. There will be opportunities for nursery workers, truck drivers, tree planters, crew managers, auditors, monitoring/silviculture workers, brush saw operators, foresters for assessment, planning block layout (marking boundaries) workers, site prep operators, and more.",

  "q20": "Why should I invest with CFT and not a charity?",
